## Examples Resource Pack

[CustomiesWikiPack](https://github.com/CustomiesDevs/CustomiesWikiPack) is an example resource pack that implements all
the examples found in this wiki. It can also be used as a guide to creating your own.

> Customies is just a plugin which provides an API for developers to register custom features. Developers are expected
> to create the resource pack themselves, and should use resources like [wiki.bedrock.dev](https://wiki.bedrock.dev) for
> guides on creating them. For support with the Customies API, you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Tm6wGxWqgh).
